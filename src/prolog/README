Part 1: Integer Merge Sort in Prolog
------------------------------------

Specification
Write a Prolog predicate of arity 2 named int_mergesort that is satisfied when the first parameter is an integer list and the second parameter is a sorted version of the first parameter.

int_mergesort  

The first parameter may be assumed to always be instantiated with a ground term when int_mergesort is used in a top-level goal. Thus, int_mergesort behaves like a function from its first parameter to its second parameter.

Additional Details
------------------
* Your solution must use a form of the merge sort algorithm.
* Since the parameters are specified to be integer lists, you may freely use the built-in Prolog predicates on integers (<, <=, =:=, ...).
* You will need to introduce auxilary predicates to implement splitting the list and merging two sorted lists.
* In comments, introduce each top-level goal. Thus, int_mergesort behaves like a function from its first parameter to its
